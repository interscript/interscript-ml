## tha-g2p-base-1.0 — Thai G2P distillation (2026-08-19)

Sequence-level KD: B-K/umt5-thai-g2p-v2-0.5k teacher -> ByT5-base
student over 48,757 beam-4 teacher-generated labels (Kaikki + epitran
Wikipedia corpus, deduplicated, degenerate outputs filtered). Harness:
beam-4, corpus-level PER (total_ed / total_gold over characters of
joined-piece decode), 1,219 held-out Kaikki Thai test sentences
(`src/gpu/modal_distill.py::evaluate_per`).

| Model | PER | Exact match |
|---|---|---|
| Teacher (B-K/umt5 hub base) | 4.43% | 95.57% |
| **Student (ByT5-base, gate)** | **9.19%** | 90.81% |

Distillation cost: +4.76pp, inside the +5pp budget
(docs/DISTILL-SOURCE-PROMPT.md). ByT5-small ablations for reference:
12.63% on 23K labels, 12.06% on 48.7K labels (capacity-limited, both
rejected by the gate).

Context: the secryst-published 2.32% umt5 teacher is unrecoverable
from saved artifacts (transformers 5.15 save drops the untied umt5
lm_head) and the volume's epitran augmentation corpus is tone-less;
this release distills the best verified teacher available. A repaired
2.32%-tier teacher re-enters this pipeline when secryst regenerates it.
